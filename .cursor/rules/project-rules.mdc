You are assisting in building an enterprise-style smart workplace platform called SpaceFlow.

This repository is a monorepo containing multiple independent services under /services.
Each service:
- Is independently deployable
- Owns its own data
- Must not share code or databases with other services

Architecture principles:
- API-first design
- Clear service boundaries
- Simplicity over overengineering
- No Kubernetes
- Docker Compose is the orchestration layer
- No hidden magic or unnecessary abstractions

Expectations:
- Generate clear, readable, boring code
- Prefer explicit configuration over conventions
- Do not introduce new tools, frameworks, or patterns unless explicitly asked
- If something is ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of guessing
